This project create a button that triggers a pop up with collapsible menu.
The collapsible menu contains 2 kinds of items - expandable item and unexplainable.
Each time you expand a expandable item, a dummy API call is being triggered and we get new items to the menu - below the expanded item.

please execute yarn before use.
